## MEDEA: Mapping Environmental DEbates on Adaptation

Most debates defining the future of our society and our planet are opaque.
As regards the adaptation to climate change, the opacity is due to the
uncertainties raised by the issues at stake and the multiplicity of scales,
actors and sectors they imply. With the issue getting high in the scientific
and political agenda, clarifying such emerging debates has become top priority.

To address  this challenge, the ANR-funded MEDEA project proposes a fourfold
research programme based on the innovative methodology of controversy-mapping.

1. Firstly, drawing on a close collaboration between climate experts and
social scientists, it aims to collect an extensive corpus of scientific,
policy and media discourses on adaptation.

2. Secondly, it seeks to analyze debates in such corpus using methods and
tools developed in the field of Science and Technology Studies.

3. Thirdly, drawing on media design expertise, it aims at developing an
on-line interactive platform to make the debate legible to a large audience.

4. Finally, the project will conclude by disseminating this platform to all
relevant stakeholders in the debate.

MEDEA project is based on an original approach combining quantitative and
qualitative methods from social sciences, climate sciences and digital and
communication design.

To ensure such unusual disciplinary articulation, the project involves the
collaboration of three partners:

* Sciences Po (médialab and IDDRI),
* the LSCE,
* and the ENSAD.

Given its extensive experience in controversy mapping, Sciences Po médialab
ensures the management of the project, under the scientific coordination of
Tommaso Venturini.

In this manner, MEDEA aims to support policy development and public debate
on adaptation and to provide a relevant contribution to the understanding of
the processes underlying the adaptation and governance.
